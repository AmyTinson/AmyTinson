# 👋 Hi, I'm Amy!

## I'm a software engineer with professional experience coding in JavaScript and TypeScript. ☕
### I utilize React and AWS to make cool stuff happen in the cloud ☁️

#### 🌱 Because I'm obsessed with learning, I'm playing around with Go, Python, and Rust 🦀

#### I [practice algorithms](https://github.com/AmyTinson/leet-code) sometimes too, because I ❤️ clean, optimized, readable code.

#### 👯 I'm looking to contribute to open source projects

### Let's get in touch:
