# 👋 Hi, I'm Amy!

## I'm a software programmer with professional experience writing in JavaScript and Typescript.  I utilize React, Koa, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, Terraform, and other things to make cool stuff happen in the cloud ☁️

### Because I'm obsessed with learning, I also like to play around with Python and Go.  I practice algorithms sometimes too, because I ❤️ clean, optimized, readable code.

#### 💻 I'm currently creating a space shooter in Godot (a fun portfolio project!)

#### 🌱 I'm currently learning Go, Python, and GDScript (Godot)

#### 👯 I'm looking to contribute to open source projects
