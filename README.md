# 👋 Hi, I'm Amy!

## I'm a software developer with professional experience coding in JavaScript and Typescript.  I utilize React, Koa, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and other things to make cool stuff happen in the cloud ☁️

### Because I'm obsessed with learning, I also like to play around with Python, Go, and Ruby.
### I practice algorithms sometimes too, because I ❤️ clean, optimized, readable code.

#### 💻 I'm currently creating a [game in React](https://github.com/AmyTinson/diy-game-engine) (a fun side project!)

#### 🌱 I'm also currently learning Go, Python, and Ruby 💎
> I've started using [exercism.org](https://exercism.org/) and it's a pretty great resource for those of you who learn best by doing!

#### 👯 I'm looking to contribute to open source projects
